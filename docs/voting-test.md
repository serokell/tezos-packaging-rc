# Voting with voting wizard

This document explains how one can test voting via voting wizard on during all possible
amendment periods.

## Prerequisites

1) Install `tezos-baking` package should on your system.
2) Clone [local-chain repository](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/local-chain).

## Test scenario workflow

1) Generate a pair of keys associated with `baker` alias:

```bash
sudo -u tezos tezos-client gen keys baker
```

2) In a separate terminal start a [voting scenario script](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/local-chain#voting-scenario) from the local-chain repo.

This script will provide you a path to the node config that will be used by the custom baking service.

3) Provide address generated on the first step to the `voting.py` script. This address will receive some amount of XTZ.

4) Create a config for the custom baking service that will be used by the voting wizard:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/default/tezos-baking-custom@ /etc/default/tezos-baking-custom@voting
```

Edit with the config provided by the voting script on the second step:

```
DATA_DIR="/var/lib/tezos/.tezos-client"
NODE_RPC_ADDR="http://localhost:8732"
BAKER_ADDRESS_ALIAS="baker"
CUSTOM_NODE_CONFIG="<paste your path to the node config here>"
RESET_ON_STOP=""
LIQUIDITY_BAKING_TOGGLE_VOTE="pass"
```

Additionally, you can set `RESET_ON_STOP="true"` to enable automatic node directory removal which will
be triggered once custom baking service will be stopped.

5) Start custom baking service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tezos-baking-custom@voting
```

Note that `tezos-node` service may take some time to generate a fresh identity and start.

To check the status of the node service run:

```bash
systemctl status tezos-node-custom@voting
```

6) Register `baker` key as delegate once `tezos-node` is up and running:

```bash
sudo -u tezos tezos-client register key baker as delegate
```

7) After that `voting.py` will start going through the voting cycle.

The script will stop at the beginning of each voting period that requires voting and ask you to vote.

Launch the wizard by running:

```bash
tezos-vote --network voting
```

Under normal conditions, you won't have to adjust any information about your baking service.
Confirm the information and submit your vote.

Once you'll vote, you should prompt the `voting.py` script to continue going through the voting cycle.

8) Stop custom baking service once voting cycle is over:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tezos-baking-custom@voting
```
